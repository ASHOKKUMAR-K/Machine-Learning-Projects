## Overview
In this repository, you can find all the Machine Learning projects which was done by me and deployed on Heroku platform. This app was built with Flask framework

## Motivation
Since I want to utilize this lockdown period usefully, I have done some projects based on Machine Learning Algorithms which makes me learning new concepts and techniques and so improving my knowledge day by day.
