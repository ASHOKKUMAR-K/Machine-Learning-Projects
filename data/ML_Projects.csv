1,Iris Species Classification,27-Jun-2020,30-Jun-2020,"In this project we will classify the Iris species based on their features such as Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width.","This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and to learn the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling and finally to build a machine learning model.",images/photos/iris.jpg,Decision_Tree_Classifier,images/photos/sklearn.jpeg|images/photos/numpy.png|images/photos/pandas.png|images/photos/matplotlib.jpg|images/photos/seaborn.png,5,Flask,Python 3.7.7,99.11,100,#iris_species,iris_species
2,Loan Status Prediction,1-Jul-2020,7-Jul-2020,"In this project, we are going to classify an individual whether he/she can get the loan amount based on his/her Income, Education, Working Experience, Loan which is taken previously, and many more factors.","This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and learning the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling, and finally to build a machine learning model along with visualization of model performance.",images/photos/loan-approved.jpg,Decision_Tree_Classifier|Logistic_Regression,images/photos/sklearn.jpeg|images/photos/numpy.png|images/photos/pandas.png|images/photos/matplotlib.jpg|images/photos/seaborn.png,5,Flask,Python 3.7.7,85.36,85.54,#loan_status,loan_status
