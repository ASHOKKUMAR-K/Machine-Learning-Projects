1,Weight Prediction,12-Jan-2020,17-Jan-2020,"In this project we will predict a person's weight based on height and gender. But with height and gender alone we can't decide weight. There are some other factors such as age, type of work, etc..,","This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and to learn the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling and finally to build a machine learning model.",images/photos/weight.png,Linear_Regression,http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html,images/photos/sklearn.png|images/photos/numpy.png|images/photos/pandas.png|images/photos/matplotlib.jpg,images/photos/flask.png,images/photos/python.png|images/photos/anaconda.png,images/photos/sublime.png|images/photos/vs_code.png,85.74,90.28,#weight_pred,weight_pred,weight_predictor,https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/04.Weight_Prediction,https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/04.Weight_Prediction
2,Gender Classification,18-Jan-2020,31-Jan-2020,"In this project we will classify a person's gender based on height and weight. But only with height and weight itself we can't predict the gender. Since this was my beginner level project, I am going to predict person's gender based on height and weight only.","This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and to learn the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling and finally to build a machine learning model.",images/photos/gender.png,Support_Vector_Classification,http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html,images/photos/sklearn.png|images/photos/numpy.png|images/photos/pandas.png|images/photos/matplotlib.jpg,images/photos/flask.png,images/photos/python.png|images/photos/anaconda.png,images/photos/sublime.png|images/photos/vs_code.png,91.47,91.9,#gender_classifier,gender_classifier,gender_classifier,https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/03.Gender_Classifcation,https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/03.Gender_Classifcation

4,Loan Status Prediction,1-Jul-2020,7-Jul-2020,"In this project, we are going to classify an individual whether he/she can get the loan amount based on his/her Income, Education, Working Experience, Loan which is taken previously, and many more factors.","This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and learning the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling and finally to build a machine learning model along with visualization of model performance.",images/photos/loan-approved.jpg,Decision_Tree_Classifier,https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html,images/photos/sklearn.png|images/photos/numpy.png|images/photos/pandas.png|images/photos/matplotlib.jpg|images/photos/seaborn.png,images/photos/flask.png,images/photos/python.png|images/photos/anaconda.png,images/photos/sublime.png|images/photos/vs_code.png,85.36,85.54,#loan_status,loan_status,loan_status_predictor,https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/02.Loan_Status_Prediction,https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/loan-status-prediction-machine-learning-model-ca703246c7ec?source=your_stories_page---------------------------
5,Boston House Price Prediction,10-Jul-2020,11-Jul-2020,"In this project, we are going to predict boston house prices based on some important features such as lower status population percentage (LSTAT), number of rooms (RM), pupil-teacher ratio by town (PTRATIO),  proportion of non-retail business acres per town (INDUS), full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 dollars (TAX), nitric oxides concentration (NOX), etc..,","This project was started as a motivation for learning Machine Learning Algorithms and learning the different data preprocessing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature Scaling and finally to build a machine learning model along with visualization of model performance using ensemble learning.",images/photos/house.jpg,Random_Forest_Regressor,http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html,images/photos/sklearn.png|images/photos/numpy.png|images/photos/pandas.png|images/photos/matplotlib.jpg|images/photos/seaborn.png,images/photos/flask.png,images/photos/python.png|images/photos/anaconda.png,images/photos/sublime.png|images/photos/vs_code.png,98.43,96.15,#boston_price,boston_price,boston_house_price_predictor,https://github.com/ASHOKKUMAR-K/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/05.Boston_House_Price_Prediction,https://medium.com/@Ashok_kumar_K/boston-housing-price-prediction-e279074f356c?source=your_stories_page---------------------------
